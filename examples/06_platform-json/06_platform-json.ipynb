For example, if\\r\\ntransmission line operators require land clearing for maintenance or\\r\\nupgrades, this could violate the permanence requirement, jeopardizing\\r\\nACCUs already issued.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Property-specific infrastructure is located predominantly in the\\r\\ncentre and southern extent of the property (Figure 7). No other major\\r\\ninfrastructure occurs within or around the property. Pages Creek\\r\\npresents as a low risk for project development. It is recommended that a\\r\\nsite visit is conducted to determine appropriate buffers around existing\\r\\ninfrastructure.</p>\\n<h2 id=\"tenure\">Tenure</h2>\\n<p>Tenure is critical for carbon projects as it establishes legal\\r\\nownership and land-use rights for the project site. Understanding the\\r\\ntenure type(s) of your project area is essential for determining project\\r\\nlegitimacy, securing necessary permissions, and identifying key\\r\\nstakeholders involved in project development. Clear tenure ensures\\r\\nlong-term stability and compliance, reducing risks to project\\r\\nsuccess.</p>\\n<p>Initial assessment indicates that the property is entirely Freehold\\r\\ntenure with the presence of a single easement (Figure 8). Pages Creek\\r\\npresents as a very low risk for project implementation. It is\\r\\nrecommended that a title check and legal expertise is required to\\r\\nconfirm the tenure-type and the presence of easements that may not be\\r\\ndigitally mapped.</p>\\n<h2 id=\"zoning\">Zoning</h2>\\n<p>Zoning dictates how land can be used, ensuring that projects align\\r\\nwith legal and regulatory frameworks. If zoning laws don‚Äôt support\\r\\nconservation or reforestation, a project might fail verification and not\\r\\ngenerate credits.</p>\\n<p>The Pages Creek property is zoned as Rural Zone (Division 1) and\\r\\nPrimary production small lots (RU4) (Figure 9) and presents as a very\\r\\nlow risk for project development.</p>\\n<h2 id=\"land-titles\">Land Titles </h2>\\n<p>It is essential to evaluate whether a proposed project area is\\r\\nsubject to land titles or other land uses that could potentially\\r\\nconflict with the development of a carbon project. While these\\r\\nalternative uses may not always prevent project implementation, they\\r\\nserve as indicators of potential risk, can influence the project\\r\\ntimeline, and help identify key stakeholders who may need to be\\r\\nconsulted during the planning process.</p>\\n<h3 id=\"native-title\">Native title</h3>\\n<p>Native title is a crucial assessment criterion for carbon projects as\\r\\nit identifies land tenure rights, Indigenous stakeholder engagement, and\\r\\nconsent requirements, ensuring projects comply with legal frameworks and\\r\\nrespect Traditional Owner interests.</p>\\n<p>There are no Indigenous Land Use Agreements or Native Title\\r\\nDeterminations in or around the Pages Creek property (Figure 10).\\r\\nHowever, it is recommended that early engagement with local Indigenous\\r\\ncommunities be undertaken to begin the process of obtaining free, prior,\\r\\nand informed consent.</p>\\n<h3 id=\"mining-tenements-and-exploration-licences\">Mining tenements and\\r\\nexploration licences</h3>\\n<p>Understanding mining tenements and exploration licenses help ensure\\r\\nproject security, regulatory compliance and alignment with long-term\\r\\nland management objectives. There are currently no mining tenements or\\r\\nexploration licenses that intersect with the Pages Creek property\\r\\n(Figure 11).</p>\\n<h3 id=\"existing-cer-projects\">Existing CER projects</h3>\\n<p>If an area is already covered by an existing CER project, there is a\\r\\nrisk of double counting carbon credits which can lead to non-compliance\\r\\nwith carbon standards and making credits invalid or reducing their\\r\\nmarket value. Similarly, if an existing CER project is already\\r\\naddressing the same emission reductions, the new project might fail\\r\\nadditionality tests and be ineligible for credits.</p>\\n<p>Currently, there is one CER-registered project within the entire\\r\\nproperty (ERF 194756 ‚Äì Reforestation by Environmental or Mallee\\r\\nPlanting, 2014). The CER-registered project identified immediately to\\r\\nthe east is part of the same project, while an additional, separate\\r\\nCER-registered project is located to the north (see Figure 12).</p>\\n<h1 id=\"environmental\">Environmental</h1>\\n<p>Carbon projects, particularly those involving environmental\\r\\nplantings, face various environmental risks that can affect their\\r\\nsuccess, long-term viability, and ability to generate Australian Carbon\\r\\nCredit Units (ACCUs). These risks must be carefully assessed and managed\\r\\nto ensure project permanence and compliance with Emissions Reduction\\r\\nFund (ERF) requirements.</p>\\n<h2 id=\"climate\">Climate</h2>\\n<p>Climate and weather-related risks (e.g. rainfall and temperature),\\r\\nplay a significant role in determining the success and long-term\\r\\nviability of carbon projects, and can inform when certain project\\r\\nactivities such as weed management or tree planting should take\\r\\nplace</p>\\n<h3 id=\"precipitation\">Precipitation</h3>\\n<p>The Pages Creek property is located in a temperate region with no dry\\r\\nseason and warm summers.</p>\\n<p>Precipitation is highest during summer, specifically in December,\\r\\naveraging approximately 95 mm. Rainfall then sharply decreasing through\\r\\nautumn reaching its lowest point in April, with an average of about 40\\r\\nmm.</p>\\n<p>Based on historical precipitation data, the Pages Creek property\\r\\npresents a low risk for project development. The optimal window for\\r\\nconducting tree planting operations is during the late Winter-to-Spring\\r\\nand early Summer period, when conditions are most favourable.</p>\\n<p><div class=\"chart\" data-caption=\"Figure 2.

Three prescribed\\r\\nburns were recorded in October 2012, September 2012, and March 2019. In\\r\\ncontrast, wildfires have been significantly more frequent, with at least\\r\\n17 incidents documented between October 2000 and December 2019. In 2019,\\r\\nfire also directly affected the northern extent of the property (Figure\\r\\n17). The overall bushfire risk for the Pages Creek property is\\r\\nclassified as moderate due to the large proportion of fire-prone land\\r\\nwithin the property and its location in a region with a high frequency\\r\\nof fire.</p>\\n<h2 id=\"flood-risk\">Flood risk</h2>\\n<p><div class=\"icon\" data-caption=\"{{floodRisk}}\" data-icon-name=\"flood\" data-icon-type=\"custom\"></div>Flooding and heavy rainfall events can\\r\\nhave significant negative impacts on carbon projects. These events may\\r\\nlead to soil erosion and loss, damage to seedlings and plant root\\r\\nsystems, and in severe cases, plant mortality. Such outcomes can delay\\r\\ncarbon sequestration timelines and increase project costs due to the\\r\\nneed for replanting and site rehabilitation.</p>\\n<p>According to the National Flood Risk Model (FRM) - which uses a\\r\\nstatistical-morphological approach to estimate inundation probability -\\r\\nthe Pages Creek property is assessed as having a very low risk of\\r\\nflooding (Figure 18).</p>\\n<h2 id=\"salinity\">Salinity</h2>\\n<p>Salinity, or the concentration of salt in soil and water, can\\r\\nsignificantly influence the success and carbon sequestration potential\\r\\nof environmental projects, where high salinity can be a major constraint\\r\\non plant growth and soil health, making it a critical factor to consider\\r\\nin carbon project design and management.</p>\\n<h3 id=\"dryland-salinity\">Dryland salinity</h3>\\n<p>Dryland salinity refers to the accumulation of salts in the soil of\\r\\nnon-coastal (dryland) areas, which primarily affects agricultural lands,\\r\\nnatural ecosystems, and water quality. It occurs in areas with low\\r\\nrainfall and can result from both natural processes and human\\r\\nactivities, often exacerbated by land use changes such as agriculture\\r\\nand deforestation.</p>\\n<p>The Pages Creek property does not overlap with any areas currently\\r\\nmapped as having a high risk of dryland salinity and presents as very\\r\\nlow risk (Figure 19).</p>\\n<h1 id=\"biogeography\">Biogeography</h1>\\n<p>In the context of carbon projects, biogeography plays a crucial role\\r\\nin determining suitable and eligible locations, vegetation types, and\\r\\ncarbon sequestration potential for environmental plantings.</p>\\n<h2 id=\"vegetation\">Vegetation</h2>\\n<h3 id=\"major-vegetation-groups-pre-european-settlement\">Major\\r\\nVegetation Groups (pre-European settlement)</h3>\\n<p>Australia\\'s vegetation is classified into Major Vegetation Groups\\r\\n(MVGs) at a national scale based on dominant plant communities, climate,\\r\\nand ecological characteristics (pre-European settlement). Assessing MVGs\\r\\nacross a potential project area is critical in determining whether the\\r\\nproposed planting area can achieve forest cover<a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>2</sup></a>,\\r\\nand is suitable and eligible for project implementation.</p>\\n<p>Based on MVG mapping, the entirety of the planting area of the Pages\\r\\nCreek property can achieve forest cover and the property presents as a\\r\\nvery low risk for project development.</p>\\n<h3 id=\"fine-scale-state-based-vegetation-mapping-pre-european-settlement\">Fine-scale\\r\\nstate-based vegetation mapping (pre-European settlement)</h3>\\n<p>State-based pre-European vegetation (PEV) mapping offers more\\r\\ngranular insights into the natural ecosystems that existed before\\r\\nsignificant human intervention. PEVs help to further assess whether the\\r\\nproposed planting area can achieve forest cover but is also key for\\r\\ndefining an initial benchmark for restoration goals, guide species\\r\\nselection, optimising planting strategies, inform potential project\\r\\nco-benefits such as restoring threatened ecological communities and/or\\r\\ncritical habitat for threatened species. By restoring PEV, projects\\r\\nincrease their likelihood of qualifying for higher quality carbon\\r\\ncredits while simultaneously delivering local benefits to native flora\\r\\nand fauna, thereby improving landscape-scale system resilience.</p>\\n<p>In accordance with state-based ‚ÄòPre-European Vegetation‚Äô mapping,\\r\\nthere are 16 plant community types (PCTs) on the Pages Creek property.\\r\\nThe dominant PCTs, based on their proportion of the planting area, are\\r\\nLiverpool Range Box-Silvertop Stringybark Forest (42.95%), Northwest\\r\\nWhite Box Woodland (27.43%), Liverpool Range Montane Stringybark Forest\\r\\n(16.31%). State-based vegetation mapping supports the MVG\\r\\nclassification, indicating that Pages Creek poses a very low risk for\\r\\nproject development, as all eligible planting areas are capable of\\r\\nachieving forest cover.</p>\\n<h2 id=\"soil\">Soil</h2>\\n<p>Soil is fundamental to the success of any restoration project,\\r\\ndirectly impacting plant establishment and long-term survival.\\r\\nUnderstanding soil characteristics helps identify risks early and\\r\\ninforms key actions such as targeted soil testing, land remediation, and\\r\\nsite preparation. A well-informed soil assessment ensures a strong\\r\\nfoundation for restoration success.</p>\\n<p>The property\\'s soil profile is dominated by Dermosols, covering\\r\\napproximately 95.38% of the area, followed by smaller proportions of\\r\\nFerrosols (2.26%), Chromosols (1.31%), and Tenosols (1.05%). Dermosols\\r\\nhave structured B2 horizons with minimal texture contrast. Chromosols\\r\\nfeature a strong texture contrast and are generally favourable for\\r\\nagriculture, although some may have subplastic B horizons requiring\\r\\nattention. Ferrosols, rich in iron oxides and known for favorable\\r\\nphysical characteristics, are widely regarded as suitable for\\r\\nenvironmental plantings. Tenosols, in contrast, are weakly developed,\\r\\noften shallow, and may overlay hardpans or rock, which restricts root\\r\\npenetration and water retention. These properties make Tenosols the\\r\\nleast favorable for tree establishment without significant management\\r\\ninterventions.</p>\\n<p>Overall, higher-risk soils comprise only a small portion of the\\r\\nproperty, indicating that Pages Creek poses a very low risk for project\\r\\ndevelopment. Nevertheless, it is advisable to conduct a site inspection\\r\\nto assess the impact of historical and current land management practices\\r\\non soil condition. Gaining insight into any changes in soil structure or\\r\\nfunction will be essential for identifying potential risks that could\\r\\naffect the success of project implementation.</p>\\n<h1 id=\"next-steps\">Next steps</h1>\\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\\n<p>Overall, Pages Creek property presents as a low yielding carbon EP\\r\\nproject with some key risks that may threaten the project viability over\\r\\ntime.

By restoring PEV, projects\\r\\nincrease their likelihood of qualifying for higher quality carbon\\r\\ncredits while simultaneously delivering local benefits to native flora\\r\\nand fauna, thereby improving landscape-scale system resilience.</p>\\n<p>In accordance with state-based ‚ÄòPre-European Vegetation‚Äô mapping,\\r\\nthere are 16 plant community types (PCTs) on the Pages Creek property.\\r\\nThe dominant PCTs, based on their proportion of the planting area, are\\r\\nLiverpool Range Box-Silvertop Stringybark Forest (42.95%), Northwest\\r\\nWhite Box Woodland (27.43%), Liverpool Range Montane Stringybark Forest\\r\\n(16.31%). State-based vegetation mapping supports the MVG\\r\\nclassification, indicating that Pages Creek poses a very low risk for\\r\\nproject development, as all eligible planting areas are capable of\\r\\nachieving forest cover.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"soil\">Soil</h2>\\n<p>Soil is fundamental to the success of any restoration project,\\r\\ndirectly impacting plant establishment and long-term survival.\\r\\nUnderstanding soil characteristics helps identify risks early and\\r\\ninforms key actions such as targeted soil testing, land remediation, and\\r\\nsite preparation. A well-informed soil assessment ensures a strong\\r\\nfoundation for restoration success.</p>\\n<p>The property\\'s soil profile is dominated by Dermosols, covering\\r\\napproximately 95.38% of the area, followed by smaller proportions of\\r\\nFerrosols (2.26%), Chromosols (1.31%), and Tenosols (1.05%). Dermosols\\r\\nhave structured B2 horizons with minimal texture contrast. Chromosols\\r\\nfeature a strong texture contrast and are generally favourable for\\r\\nagriculture, although some may have subplastic B horizons requiring\\r\\nattention. Ferrosols, rich in iron oxides and known for favorable\\r\\nphysical characteristics, are widely regarded as suitable for\\r\\nenvironmental plantings. Tenosols, in contrast, are weakly developed,\\r\\noften shallow, and may overlay hardpans or rock, which restricts root\\r\\npenetration and water retention. These properties make Tenosols the\\r\\nleast favorable for tree establishment without significant management\\r\\ninterventions.</p>\\n<p>Overall, higher-risk soils comprise only a small portion of the\\r\\nproperty, indicating that Pages Creek poses a very low risk for project\\r\\ndevelopment. Nevertheless, it is advisable to conduct a site inspection\\r\\nto assess the impact of historical and current land management practices\\r\\non soil condition. Gaining insight into any changes in soil structure or\\r\\nfunction will be essential for identifying potential risks that could\\r\\naffect the success of project implementation.</p>\\n\\n<h1 id=\"next-steps\">Next steps</h1>\\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\\n<p>Overall, Pages Creek property presents as a low yielding carbon EP\\r\\nproject with some key risks that may threaten the project viability over\\r\\ntime.
